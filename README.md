ThreeGeoJSON
=======================

This project aims to be a simple way to render geojson data in 3D with three.js.

###Demo
http://jdomingu.github.io/ThreeGeoJSON/

Note: To view the demo, ensure that your browser supports WebGL rendering.

###Instructions
Enter the following code to render a geoJSON file in 3D:
```
drawThreeGeo(json, radius, shape, {options});   
```
You can enter the following parameters: 

| Parameter | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| json | The variable that contains the geoJSON that you want to render. |
| radius | The radius of the sphere that you want to render. |
| shape | The 3D shape to use when rendering the geoJSON. Either 'sphere' or 'plane'. |
| options | The threeJS options that you want to use to style the line or particle material. |
| container | Optional. THREE.Object3D instance which will be used as a container for threejson shapes. |

For example, you might enter:
```
drawThreeGeo(json, 10, 'sphere', {
    color: 'green'
}); 
```

###Important Note About Parsing geoJSON
The demo uses the jquery $.getJSON method to pass the geoJSON to the drawThreeGeo function. You can only use this method if the geoJSON is hosted on a server that allows requests for json data. To test this code locally, complete the following steps: 

1. Add ```var json =``` to the beginning of the geoJSON file that you want to display.
2. Change the file extension of your geoJSON file to ```.js```.
3. Add the ```json.js``` file to the head of your HTML page. For example, you might add the following line:
```
<script src="test_geojson/json.js"></script>
```
